I'm currently a student at The University of Sydney, studying a double degree in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. My main interests are machine learning, bionics and neural engineering. Broadly, I enjoy working on versatile projects that have a positive impact on people's lives.

Following my high school graduation, I began working professionally as an engineer alongside my university degree commitments. For a more detailed overview of my career and experiences, please visit [my resume](https://dillondesilva.github.io/resume/).

Recently, I have founded an organisation called Neurospike. Our mission is to develop awesome software tools for neural computation.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, sim-racing and video games.
